# 🏡 💰 Who is putting their homes on AirBnb? 💰🏡
I've always been curious about the people who put up their homes on AirBnb in New York City. Who are these people? Why do they have so many houses? Let's get nosy. More broadly, I was interested in finding out how many people could potentially be doing it commercially, because then AirBnb is not the cute home-sharing platform it claims to be 😔 and is worsening the city's housing crisis 👎
